\chapter{An Introduction to Model Theory} \label{Ch1:CH}
\thispagestyle{empty}

Model Theory is one of the two main branches of mathematical logic, alongside Set Theory. We can view Model Theory as a translation of algebra to the world of set theory, or as a \textit{generalisation} of algebra, with many applications to algebra. Indeed, it is possible to view model theory as a more specialised version of category theory, at least in its power to deal with generality. We can prove tremendously deep theorems about algebra, or other fields of maths, purely using model theory.

% We also add a few historical comments that might be interesting to the reader (they were interesting to me). In the 1960s, there was a collection of papers published at two back-to-back maths conferences that together defined a field called ``model theory''. These papers sought to generalise an earlier work by Steinitz from 1910, which, over the course of 200 pages, made substantial progress on field theory, building on the work of the legendary Ã‰variste Galois. In the 70s, more papers on model theory began to appear, generalising the work of Lowenheim and Skolem from the 1910s as well as work by a group based in Warsaw led by Tarski from the late 1920s. After the break of war in 1939 and the murder of several of Tarski's colleagues at the hands of the Nazis, Tarski took refuge in the United States, where he continued his work in UC Berkeley. 

Before we can talk about model theory in any detail, we need to recall a few notions from the world of logic.
