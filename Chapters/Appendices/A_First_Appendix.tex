\section{A List of Interesting Quotes by Rami Grossberg}

\subsection{Mathematical Insights}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Universal algebra is but a weaker version of model theory. In some sense,
    \begin{align*}
        \text{Model Theory} = \text{Logic} + \text{Universal Algebra}
    \end{align*}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Beyond the Mathematical}

That doesn't mean beyond mathematics!

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``I can't remember his first name. He had a very generic first name.''
    \item ``Bourbaki stole a lot of things from logicians. Logicians hate Bourbaki, for very good reasons.''
\end{itemize}
